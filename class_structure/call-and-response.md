# Call and Response

This portion of the class is meant to re-enforce the basic concepts of programming.  Below are some options.

## Basic Concepts call and response

| Call                | Response                                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| An program is?      | Set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. |
| An algorithm is?    | A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. |
| The basic data types in Python are?[^2] | integer, float, string, bool|
| The built-in sequence types in Python are?[^2] | list, tuple, range     |
| A function is?      | A reusable unit of code.                        |
| A class is?         | A user-defined data type.                       |
| An object is?       | An instance of a class.                         |
| An object has?[^3]  | Members, attributes and methods.               |

[^2]: There are more types than covered in response.  Response just has the types we'll cover in the course.  See more information at <https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#>

[^3]: How these concepts are surfaced is language dependent.  In some languages attributes are called properties.  Sometimes attributes/properties are defined as methods with special naming conventions.  Sometimes attributes/properties are called getters/setters.  Methods are sometimes called actions.  Methods are functions attached to an object.
