## Basic programming concepts

| Call                | Response                                        |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|

| The two types are typing are? | Dynamic and static.|
| The basic data types in Python are? * | integer, float, string, char, bool |
| The complex data types in Python are? * | List, Set, Dictionary, Tuple |
| The two types of programming are? | Functional and Object-Oriented.|
| A function is?      | A reusable unit of code.|
| A class is?         | A user-defined data type.|
| An object is?       | An instance of a class.|
| An object has? **   | Members, attributes and methods.|

\* There are more types than covered in response.  Response just has the types we'll cover in the course.

\*\* How these concepts are surfaced is language dependent.  In some languages attributes are called properties.  Sometimes attributes/properties are defined as methods with special naming conventions.  Sometimes attributes/properties are called getters/setters.  Methods are sometimes called actions.  Methods are functions attached to an object.
