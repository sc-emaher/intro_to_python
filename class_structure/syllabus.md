# Syllabus for Introduction to Coding with Python

## Introduction

At Summit, we’ve been cautious and intentional about introducing technology into the classroom.  Learning is interpersonal, that is, a relational exchange between a loving, Godly, and devoted teacher with a group of learners.  

However, technology is integral part of modern life and and some have been blessed with the curiosity and desire to use technology.  As with many of gifts, technology can be used as a weapon or tool.  In this class, students will learn the basic concepts and terms used when programming so we they use those skills to serve others and solve time-consuming problems quickly.

    1 Peter 4:10
    
    Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, 
    as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.

Lessons will be taught in an interactive and relational form.  In the "real world" programs aren't created in silos-- they often require several people working together.

### Guiding principles

- Coding is creative, playful, and full of problem-solving opportunities
- Strategic algorithmic thinking aligns well with the logical cognitive development in the dialectic stage
- Students get to act as designers & creators, rather than just consumers
- Students will become part of a classroom culture of fearless exploration and peer collaboration

## Grading

| Percentage | Item |
|-|-|
| 40% | **Class participation.**  Concepts will be taught in-class with example code.  Students will be expected to turn in their copy of the code at the end of class.  |
| 40% | **Skill assessment.**  After each concept is taught students will be asked to demonstrate knowledge of those concepts by completing an programming assignment.  Assessments are designed to be completed in-class.|
| 20% | **Quizzes and projects.** Through out the unit, short quizzes will be given to reinforce concepts and vocabulary.  At the end of the semester, students will be given a few weeks of class time to work on and receive help to create a fun program that uses all the skills they have been taught.  |

## Daily Routine

Every class period, please:

- Arrive to class in a timely manner and find your assign seat.  
- Have your laptop ready.
- Have paper and pencil within easy reach.
- Immediately start warm-up task.

After a short warm-up task, we will recite our call-and-response, we start the unit lesson, or work on program assignments for that unit.

### Materials

Students will need their *fully charged* laptop everyday.  If a student forgets their computer, they will need to take hand-written notes and complete their skill assessment for homework.

Laptop will need to be capable of running the following software:

- **Visual Studio Code**. See [requirements for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/supporting/requirements) ([https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/supporting/requirements](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/supporting/requirements))
- **Python 3.10.x** See [Python releases for Windows](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)([https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/a)) or [Python releases for MacOS](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)([https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)).

Students will not need their full binder, but should have a pencil and a few sheets of paper available if warm-up activity requires paper.

## Resources

**There is no required book for this course.**  All require concepts and skills will be introduced in class. Lessons will be posted for future use along with optional resources at the end of each lesson.

The course will pull lessons and projects from the following books:
  
- The online book **Intro to Python Textbook** available at [https://codehs.com/textbook/intropython_textbook/](https://codehs.com/textbook/intropython_textbook/)
- **Python Crash Course** by Eric Matthes.  ISBN 978-1-7185-0720-3

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Daily lessons and assignments will be posted to <https://github.com/sc-emaher/intro_to_python>

There are several online resources for learning Python.  Here are some popular examples:

- Python Cheat Sheet: [https://zerotomastery.io/cheatsheets/python-cheat-sheet/](https://zerotomastery.io/cheatsheets/python-cheat-sheet/)
- W3 Schools Python Interpreter: [https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_default](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_default)
- Online Python Interpreter: [https://www.online-python.com/](https://www.online-python.com/)
- Online REPL Python Interpreter: [https://pyscript.net/examples/repl.html](https://pyscript.net/examples/repl.html)  (Takes some time to load.)
- Python Learning Module: [https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/beginner-python/](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/paths/beginner-python/)
- Python Official documentation [https://www.python.org/doc/](https://www.python.org/doc/)

## Absences and tardies

If a student misses a class, they will be expected to:

- Learn missed concept separately.  Each lesson will have a "sources" section that the student can use.  Student should reach out to educator if there are any questions.  
- Find the in-class code uploaded by the educator and copy the code, execute the code, and turn it into the teacher.
- Complete the assignment for the missed lesson.  School absentee policy will be followed.

If you arrive after the class has been greeted, you are tardy.  School tardy policy will be followed.

## Behavior Expectations

- Be Respectful
- Be Responsible
- Be Ready to Learn

The same high standards for maturity, grace, respect, and responsibility are assumed in this course, but in addition, I expect complete compliance and integrity with our technology use standards as well.  All students and parents will be required to carefully read, sign, and abide by the school’s Technology Use Agreement.  In joining this course, students have been bestowed with a high level of trust, and as such, I expect they will demonstrate the highest character.  

I have read and understand all of the material presented in this document.
