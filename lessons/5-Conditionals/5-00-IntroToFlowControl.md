# Unit 5 - Flow Control

There are several devices that Python offers to allow programmers to control the flow of a program based on user input or the state of variables.  We will be covering the following devices:

| Device | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `if-elif-else` statement| Execute a certain set of code based on the truth value of a boolean statement. |
| `while` loop|  Uses a boolean expression to determine when the loop should be stopped. |
| `for` loop | Executes the code for each item in a given list. |
