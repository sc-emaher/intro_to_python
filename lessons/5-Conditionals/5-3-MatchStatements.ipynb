    "# Match Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "The `match` statements can make your code look cleaner when you have a several `if` and `elif` statements of a certain type in a row.  It's what some programmers call \"syntax sugar\".  While the code is easier to read for humans, it's all the same to the computer as the interpreter will convert the `match` statement into a series of `if-elif-else` statements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `match` statement does pattern matching.  Sometimes for more complicated code, you may have to stick with and `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: It's best practice to use a `match` statement only when there are multiple `if` and `elif`.  While syntactically correct, it's a little silly to use if for a simple `if-else` statement.\n",
