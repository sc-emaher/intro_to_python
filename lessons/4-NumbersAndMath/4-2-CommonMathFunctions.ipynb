    "Notes:\n",
    "- Mod is a common operator used by programmers.  We often are enforcing business rules in the code we write and have to find if there is something left over. When both numbers are positive, a % b is the same as find the remainder of a / b.\n",
    "- Floor is convenient to divide something, but force the return type to be an int.\n",
