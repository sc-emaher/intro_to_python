## Checking Installation

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
1. Create a new file called `Lesson1.ipynb`
1. Now, let's validate our Python Version.

    > Code to validate our Python version:
    >
    > ```python
    > import sys
    > print(sys.version)
    > ```
    >

1. Run code by executing cell.  (Type Ctrl+Enter or select 'play' button.)  This will take a while because several files need to be downloaded.
1. If prompted to **Select Kernel** by VSCode, select 'Python Environments', select installed Python version.

**Python-ism**. Tim Peters wrote some sayings to help guide programmers as they create code.

> import this
